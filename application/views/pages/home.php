            		a necessary one. When gutters aren't working they can create havoc on
            		your house in the following ways:</P>
            		<UL>
            			<li>Allow groundwater to sit around the
            	foundation causing leaks, cracks or flooding basements</li>
            			<li>Create a haven for insects and
            			mosquito breeding grounds</li>
            			<li>Become heavy and pull gutters loose,
            	allowing water to flow into the exposed portion of your home.</li>
            			<li>Creating ice dams on the roof that
            	force water inside your house</li>
            		</UL>
            		<img class="img-rounded" width="166px" height="132px" src="./images/leafy.jpg" alt="Gutter full of Leaves" >
            		<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The frequency with which you choose to
            		clean your gutters is likely to be based on the amount of trees in
            		your yard. Obviously older tall trees close to the house will cause
            		more leaves, branches and debris to fall onto the roof getting caught
            		in the gutter.</P>
            		<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Gutter caps and screens may reduce the
            		frequency of having to clean your gutters but do not block all
            		debris, they also make it more difficult to clean when it is needed.</P>
            		<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Don't let this chore find its way to
            		the bottom of the todo list. The neglect that can result from it is
            		too costly to play with.
